# UW-Machine-Learning-Specialization
My coursework from the University of Washington Machine Learning Specialization

## Description
The specialization is divided into four courses, each approximately 6 weeks in length:
* Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach
* Machine Learning: Regression
* Machine Learning: Classification
* Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval

The Jupyter Notebooks contain my solutions to all of the coursework in the Specialization. The notebooks have several dependencies which must be satisfied to run them:
* Some of the notebooks rely of Turi GraphLab Create. GraphLab Create must be installed in the local Python environment for those notebooks.
* Datasets for a given course must be located in the same directory as the notebook. To run a notebook, download and extract the appropriate course dataset into the folder containing the notebook.
* All notebooks are written and tested in Python 2.7.14.
